# CallBox-Assignment


## Assignment
* Exercise One: Create a staff page using HTML and CSS. 
* Exercise Three: Create a navigation bar using HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Bonus Exercise: Compare two arrays and output all matching values. 


## Stage Page
I took a minimalist approach to the staff page. The webpage has a color scheme of blacks and whites, with the employee photos adding color to the page once a user hovers over them. 


## Navigation Bar
I took the same approach to the navigation bar. The navigation bar's functionality comes from JavaScript with styling from CSS.  


## Bonus Exercise
The bonus exercise is in the index.js file. I console logged the results which can be viewed in the console of the inspector tools.  I approached this exercise in two different ways. First, I used the javascript method includes and compared the arrays. Second, I looped through both arrays and pushed any matching item to a new array.
